# HTML5 Canvas renderer class

create html 5 canvas renderer class that

- mimics visually (not technically) ZX Spectrum graphics
- controls html 5 canvas element in DOM
- accepts objects that are instructing what and where to draw on canvas
- scale graphic objects from their original defined dimensions to current canvas sixe on screen while being crisp (taking account current canvas size on screen and pixel density)
- respect project's exising file structure. organize files into respecive folders or files if exists (interfaces, abstracts, constants, etc)
- do not add comments unless it's tricky to understand
  do not make summary about what you created
